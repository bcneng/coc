# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as pledge to
making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

## Expected Behaviour

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

## Unacceptable Behavior

* Conduct or speech which might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, 
  transphobic,   ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.
  - Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
  - Do not show disrespect towards others. (Jokes, innuendo, dismissive attitudes.)
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment. Please read the [Citizen Code of Conduct][citizen-coc]
  for how we interpret harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Violence, threats of violence or violent language.

## Our Responsibilities

Community admins are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Also have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments and
other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any member for other behaviors that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, 
PLEASE contact the project team at bcnengineers at gmail dot com and we will help you.

The admin team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter 
of an incident.

## Language

BcnEng doesn't have a default language. Everyone is free to use any language they prefer, as long as it is done with respect and following this code. 
We know it would be ideal to use a language that everyone understands, but we know that's impossible to achieve as most of our members speak Catalan and Spanish.
We also know that a lot of members use English as a way to communicate, as it's considered a universal language, but we cannot and will not force anyone to study a foreign language and abandon their native language.
