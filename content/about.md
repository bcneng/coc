## The Mission

BcnEng's mission is to let Barcelona's tech hub to become one of the best tech
communities around the globe.

How?

- Promoting and spreading technical knowledge
- Enhancing personal and professional relationships in a frame of diversity
- Foment training among the community

We will do that keeping our values:

- Transparency
- Community-driven
- Diversity
- Open source

We are working on becoming a non-profit in order to have more resources for
reaching those goals.

## The History

BcnEng's Slack started as a solution for a communication problem between two
ex-colleagues ([Sergio Moya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smoya) and [Gonzalo
Serrano](https://gon.cat)) that worked in the team in a Barcelona startup for
years but parted ways for new jobs in November, 2016. They wanted to keep
beeing in touch as a group and found Slack was the solution.

Months passed and the community kept growing slowly but steady, till today with
more than 3200 registered users and around 1000 weekly active users.
